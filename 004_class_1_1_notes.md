Notes on class 1.1
------------------

### Agenda

  1. Name game, get to know one another.
    a. name, why you took the class, favorite fruit or vegetable.
  2. What does class usually look like
    - 20 mins or so of "lecture"
      - walkthrough an example similar to today's studio

  3. Tips for getting unstuck.
    - Google it.
    - Go for a walk. Maybe make some tea.
    - Write down the things you've tried, and the reasons they didn't work the way you expected.
    - Ask someone else. Some things to keep in mind:
      - "It didn't work" is not very specific.
      - If your question is about a piece of code, please include the code.
    - Stack Overflow has some good advice about asking questions. https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask
    - Try and think of a question where, if you only knew the answer, you'd be able to make some progress.
    - Please don't spend more than 30 minutes or so stuck and frustrated on the same issue. There are lots of "corners" -- places where it's easy to get stuck -- in learning programming. That's why you have a guide! Send me an email and I'll try and get you back on the right path.

  4. Together on computer
    - get everyone set up with github.
    - How to run atom?
      - write a small program and save it with the .py extension
    - What is python?
      - run `python --version` (to make sure it's installed correctly)
      - run `python path/to/their/program_from_above.py`
    - How to use textbook
      - copy-paste their code out of atom into the activecode window, run it there.
    - How to turn in an exercise using a gist.
      - copy-paste their code into a new github gist. Save it, and email the link to coding101@devetry.com

### Notes

The students had not done the computer literacy self-assessment, but had been asked to arrive to class 30 min early to do it then. We'll probably want to make like a web quiz or something for next time. Not sure that we're going to see any data from it this time.

It would have been useful to have an aid to:
  - hand out the photo release and the correct parking pass, so I could actively listen to their response to "why you took the class".
  - help students whose computers weren't set up correctly
  - help students who weren't used to macOS
  - be another person who could bounce around helping with software setup
  - help the two students who brought in their own windows computers to download Atom and Git Bash.

Some students didn't receive the email about the reading. One registered for the class this morning. It wasn't necessary for today's class, but it means they have to read 4 chapters before Thursday's class.
