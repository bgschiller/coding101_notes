Coding Class Preparedness Self-Assessment
=========================================

## File Management

### Types of Files

This lesson and the next three lessons will give you an overview of your file system and how to manage it. It is important to understand files and folders for a few reasons.

- You will need to create file structures for all of your coding projects.
- You will also be regularly locating, moving, coping, and renaming files and folders.
- When you install new software you will need to locate the files you've downloaded, unzip them, and recognize what kind of file types they are.

In this lesson we will learn how to identify different file types by their extensions.

#### Exercises:

If you're not sure how to do any of these exercises, watch this video first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-EID5_2D9U

1. What type of file does the ".doc" or ".docx" extension indicate?
2. What type of file does the ".txt" extension indicate?
3. What are three file extensions used for image files?

### All About Folders

Learn how to display and organize your files and folders so that it is easy for you to find the information you need.

#### Exercises

If you're not sure how to do any of these exercises, watch this video and then try again: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGd48PGbnBs . The first part of this video will review how to do this on a Mac and the second part demonstrates this on Windows.

1. Open your Finder (Mac) or File Explorer (Windows).
2. In your Documents folder, display your files and folders in a list. Now change to display your files and folders as icons. (Or vice-versa).
3. Change the sorting option by clicking on the "Date Modified" header. Then change it back to sorting by "Name".
4. Choose a file and rename it. Then rename the file back to what it was.
5. Make a new folder and name it, "FilePractice". Then make a subfolder in it and name it, "Subfolder".
6. Practice selecting multiple files by using the Command key on Mac or the Control key on Windows. Then do the same using the shift key.

### Copy and Move Files

Learn what the difference is between copying and moving files, when to use each technique, and what the default behavior of your file manager is for dragging files.

#### Exercises

If you're not sure how to do any of these exercises, watch this video and then try again: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7mAoa0fOts . Again, the first part of this video will review how to do this on a Mac and the second part demonstrates this on Windows.

1. Move a file into the newly created Subfolder folder. Then move it back to where it was.
2. Copy a file into Subfolder. Then delete the copy of the file (but NOT the original).
3. Create a new Word or text file named "Hello" and save it to Subfolder.
4. Create another new Word or text file named "HelloAgain" and save it to Subfolder.
5. Copy all files in Subfolder into FilePractice using Ctrl + A, Ctrl + C, and Ctrl + V. (On a Mac, this will be Cmd + A, Cmd + C, Cmd + V).

### Compressed Archive Files

As a programmer, you will frequently have to create and use zip files. When you want to email your project to someone, you will need to "zip" the folder containing your project's files before you can send it. And when you download someone else's project (or a software application you want to install), you will need to "unzip" their files to use them. In this video we will learn how to both create and open zip files on both Mac and Windows.

#### Exercises

1. Create a zip (compressed) file of your FilePractice folder.
2. Email this zip file to yourself.
3. Download and extract/open this zip file. Then verify that its contents are the same as your original FilePractice folder.

### Congratulations!

You've completed this module and learned some important file management skills! Now it's time to brush up your math skills by reviewing the concepts that are pertinent to programming!


## Math Fundamentals

(We'd like to use EGTC's regular math test here. Perhaps we'll additionally want these extra topics?)

### Averages

When you take a class in a computer programming language, many of the assignments and practice problems involve calculating an average value. There are three types of averages: mean, median, and mode. In this lesson we will focus on finding the mean average of a set of numbers.

If you're unsure about averages, watch this video before trying the exercises: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZsMY15xeU

#### Exercises

1. Over the course of 4 games, a basketball player scores 12, 20, 36, and 8 points. What is her average score per game?
2. Aidan received the following scores on his Chemistry tests: 80, 90, 70, 100, 70, 100. What is his average test score?
3. Sally has an average exam score of 87 based on 3 Algebra exams taken so far. What score would Sally need to get on her next Algebra exam to bring her average score up to 90?

### Percentages

As is the case with averages, in computer science classes and in real-life applications, you will often write code involving percentages.

If you're unsure about percentages, watch this video before trying the exercises: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZsMY15xeU

#### Exercises

1. There are 36 students in a class and 9 of these students failed their History test. What percentage of these students failed their test?
2. Paula spends $600 per month on rent. If that amount of money is 40% of her monthly income, then how much money does Paula make per month?
3. What is 55% of 40?
4. What is .1% of 3000?
5. A football team played 52 games in one season. They won nearly 90% of their games. About how many games did they win? (Round to the nearest whole number.)

### Number types

Understanding the types of numbers will be very useful as you study programming. In computer science classes, you'll encounter different names for types of numbers, such as "integers", "floats", and "doubles". This video is a primer on basic number types. Later you will learn programming-specific terms for number types.

#### Exercises

For each blank, choose one of the following: Natural Number, Integer, Rational Number, Irrational Number, Real Number. (For many blanks multiple correct answers exist).

1. -6.06 is a _________ and a ____________, but it's not a ____________.
2. -9/37 is a _________ and a ____________, but it's not a ____________.
3. 10 is a ____________ and a ____________, but it's not a ____________.
4. -198 is a __________ and a ____________, but it's not a ____________.
5. 3.05005050005... is a ____________ and a ____________, but it's not a ___________.
