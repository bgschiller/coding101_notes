Welcome to Coding 101! I'm looking forward to meeting everyone on Tuesday.

Before the first class on Tuesday, 9/5 at 6pm, please complete the prep work assignment. This assignment can be found in Brightspace under Unit 1 (Class 1.1 Prep). In case you don't have access to Brightspace yet, the first day's prep work is to read the first 2 chapters of coding101.devetry.com, and attempt at least 5 of the exercises at the end of chapter 2.

Class will be at 1205 Osage St., Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6pm to 8pm. The first day of class is September 5th, and the last day will be October 24th.

If you're stuck on a programming problem, or have another question, you can email coding101@devetry.com. Sending an email to that address will reach several people (including myself), and one of us will try to answer your question. You can also email me directly (brian@devetry.com) but, because there's only one of me, I may be slower responding. We'll talk more about how to get help in this class on the first day.

Oh, one other thing. Emily Griffith Technical College will be providing laptops for everyone, but they may not leave the building. If you have a laptop of your own, you're welcome to use it instead.

See you Tuesday!
